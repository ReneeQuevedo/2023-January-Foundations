                            Design is my bread and butter. I love the challenge of solving a problem visually. There are always new trends 
                            to try and add your own twist to and I find great joy in exploring this realm of creativity. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In my projects, I look to solve the problem at hand first and then look to add creative flare. I like to collect 
                            all the should-be could-be information we want to communicate and work towards presenting three strong iterations.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Through all my design you will find thoughtful consideration to balance and the respect to text and graphical elements.

                            The perfect storm of visuals and storytelling. Branding is the most important first impression you could make with any customer.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Good branding the ones where at each point of interaction you get a feel for who they are not just by the same color palette they use but 
                            by tone in which they communicate. You can describe them with the same words you use to describe a person and that's because they 
                            put a lot of thought into their brand. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I strive for that. I donâ€™t want you to have a great logo mark and cool colors, I want all that and then some. That little bit of 
                            extra consideration that makes your brand completely recognizable in a line-up of your  competitors.

                        <div class="description">
                            My career has led me to many experiences within the marketing umbrella. Because of these many experiences it is 
                            first nature for me to think multi-platform when developing strategies.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Additionally, being that these opportunities were towards the beginning of my career I have continued to build 
                            on them since. I have found this to be something unique and useful - where most people focus on specializing 
                            I am able to tackle many aspects of a project. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In a field where the tactics and platforms are always changing it is important to stay nimble and my career 
                            this far had been nothing short of that.
