                <h2>HI THERE!</h2>
                <p>
                    It's a pleasure to virtually get to introduce myself to you!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As you are well aware from the name of my site, my name is Renee! I am certified creative with
                    experience and knowledge in just about all things design and design strategy. I reside in Omaha, NE where
                    I live with my husband and dog.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To give you a taste of what it is like to work with me I hope you visit my Recommendations page.
                    I have asked previous co-works and clients to write a review so you don't have to track them down and ask yourself!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In addition to their words, I just want you to know that in the most simpilest of terms - I am hard worker.
                    I like to impress those I am rubbing elbows with, and any work that comes across my desk will be nothing short of that.
                    I am always looking for the most up-to-date trends - no project will be presented without hours of research
                    and a hole lot of hours making it perfect.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My original 'trade' was in graphic design. In college I received a Bachelors of Journalism
                    with and emphasis in Advertising and Public Relations from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I also
                    received double minors in Art and Sociology. However, since college I have created quite the resume [You can download that below].
                    Throughout my career, I have continued to grow and find ways to keep building out my creative toolbox. Whether is be learning
                    social media marketing, email marketing, web developement and wed design I am always trying to make myself more versitile.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To be completely honest, I have just been trying to find what suits me best, but all along the way I just keep discovereing more.
                    I like to think that makes me valuable, some people (maybe even you) might prefer someone with a specialization or deep knowledge in one thing.
                    However, I've always seen that as limiting. I think there is something to be said about a teammate who can help do it all, not one that picks and chooses their battles.
                    WHile I'm sure my sanity might benefit from a work ethic like that, it doesn't make me feel fullfilled. I prefer to be a client's one stop shop. AND if I can't help you 
                    get it done, you better belive I will send you a list of resources I know that can.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There is lots more to say about me but I can only stand to write aout myself for so long.
                    I hope you'll reach out and connect and I look forward to impressing you with my work.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Thanks for visting,
