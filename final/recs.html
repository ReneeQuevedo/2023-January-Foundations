                    <p>Renee is first and foremost a problem solver. Whether it’s creating architectural renderings of a remodel, NIL care packages, or event planning, 
                        web design, copywriting, even developing an entire campaign strategy—she approaches every project we throw at her with positivity and, it’s 
                        cheesy but true, a can-do attitude. She’s a one in a million talent!</p>

                    <p>Renee is the definition of easy to do business with. When I need her assistance with a project, 
                        it’s guaranteed that her work will be innovative, timely and error free. Her communication style 
                        is clear and concise, additionally, she is always available for further discussion if necessary. 
                        She has truly elevated our branding efforts across the board and found a way to seamlessly tie all aspects 
                        of our business together!</p>

                    <p>Almost a year ago I started a clothing brand called Wildly Well. Renee has been by my side since the start of Wildly Well 
                        and I could tell you first hand that I wouldn’t want anyone else to team up with to build one great company. Renee and I 
                        meet once a month and always communicate with each other between the gaps of when we meet. She has always been reliable 
                        to work with regarding showing up for meetings, getting back to me via email or text and always going above and beyond 
                        what I even ask from her. Renee is always positive and that’s definitely something that makes me always remind myself 
                        and why it’s so great to have her around to start a brand from scratch. Building a brand from scratch is definitely not 
                        easy. It takes commitment, consistency, positively, and a great work ethic and I can tell you Renee has all of that! 
                        It’s been such an honor working with Renee and I hope to be able to keep her around!!</p>
